This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This uses a repurposed project created by me as the base. The original repository can be found [Here](https://github.com/ryanhikel/healthy-kids)

The applications purpose is to provide the user with information on the current COVID-19 pandemic. There is a section to load articles related to COVID using the [News API]( https://newsapi.org/docs/get-started) and a section to see the current stats of a particular state using [The COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/api).

Things to change
1. Refactor repeating css in all components.
2. Add search functionallity to article loading page rather than load all articles.
3. Replace state selection dropdown with a search bar.
4. Clean article descriptions (some have html tags that are not processed).
5. Have article cards be a uniform size to make for a nicer visual.
